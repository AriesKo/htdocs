The Raspberry Pi is equipped with one SPI bus that has 2 chip selects.
The SPI master driver is disabled by default on Raspbian. 
To enable it, use raspi-config, or ensure the line dtparam=spi=on isn't commented out in  /boot/config.txt, and reboot. 
If the SPI driver was loaded, you should see the device /dev/spidev0.0.
