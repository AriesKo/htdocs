The SoCs used on the Raspberry Pis have two built-in UARTs, a PL011 and a mini UART. 
They are implemented using different hardware blocks, so they have slightly different characteristics. 
However, both are 3.3V devices, which means extra care must be taken when connecting up to an RS232 or other system that utilises different voltage levels. 
An adapter must be used to convert the voltage levels between the two protocols. Alternatively, 3.3V USB UART adapters can be purchased for very low prices.

By default, on Raspberry Pis equipped with the wireless/Bluetooth module (Raspberry Pi 3 and Raspberry Pi Zero W), 
the PL011 UART is connected to the BT module, 
while the mini UART is used for Linux console output. 
On all other models the PL011 is used for the Linux console output.

In Linux device terms, by default, /dev/ttyS0 refers to the mini UART, and /dev/ttyAMA0 refers to the PL011. 
The primary UART is that assigned to the Linux console, which depends on the Raspberry Pi model as described above, and can be accessed via /dev/serial0.
